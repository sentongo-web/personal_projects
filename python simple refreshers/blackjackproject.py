############### Our Blackjack House Rules #####################

## The deck is unlimited in size. 
## There are no jokers. 
## The Jack/Queen/King all count as 10.
## The the Ace can count as 11 or 1.
## Use the following list as the deck of cards:
## cards = [11, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 10, 10, 10]
## The cards in the list have equal probability of being drawn.
## Cards are not removed from the deck as they are drawn.
## The computer is the dealer.

##################### Hints #####################

#Hint 1: Go to this website and try out the Blackjack game: 
#   https://games.washingtonpost.com/games/blackjack/
#Then try out the completed Blackjack project here: 
#   https://appbrewery.github.io/python-day11-demo/

#Hint 2: Read this breakdown of program requirements: 
#   http://listmoz.com/view/6h34DJpvJBFVRlZfJvxF
#Then try to create your own flowchart for the program.

#Hint 3: Download and read this flow chart I've created: 
#   https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=1rDkiHCrhaf9eX7u7yjM1qwSuyEk-rPnt

#Hint 4: Create a deal_card() function that uses the List below to *return* a random card.
#11 is the Ace.
#cards = [11, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 10, 10, 10]

import random

def deal_card():
    """ Returns a random card from the deck. """
    cards = [11, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 10, 10, 10]
    card = random.choice(cards)
    return card

def calculate_score(cards):
    """ Takes a list of cards and returns the score calculated from the cards. """
    if sum(cards) == 21 and len(cards) == 2:
        return 0  # Blackjack
    
    if 11 in cards and sum(cards) > 21:
        cards.remove(11)
        cards.append(1)
    
    return sum(cards)

# Deal the user and computer 2 cards each using deal_card() and append().
user_cards = []
computer_cards = []
is_game_over = False

for _ in range(2):
    user_cards.append(deal_card())
    computer_cards.append(deal_card())

user_score = calculate_score(user_cards)
computer_score = calculate_score(computer_cards)

print(f"Your cards: {user_cards}, current score: {user_score}")
print(f"Computer's first card: {computer_cards[0]}")

if user_score == 0 or computer_score == 0 or user_score > 21:
    is_game_over = True

# Continue the game logic here...
# You can add more game logic like user hitting or standing, computer drawing cards, etc.

# Example:
while not is_game_over:
    user_should_continue = input("Type 'y' to get another card, type 'n' to pass: ")
    if user_should_continue == 'y':
        user_cards.append(deal_card())
        user_score = calculate_score(user_cards)
        print(f"Your cards: {user_cards}, current score: {user_score}")
        
        if user_score > 21:
            is_game_over = True
    else:
        is_game_over = True

# Computer's turn
while computer_score != 0 and computer_score < 17:
    computer_cards.append(deal_card())
    computer_score = calculate_score(computer_cards)

print(f"Your final hand: {user_cards}, final score: {user_score}")
print(f"Computer's final hand: {computer_cards}, final score: {computer_score}")

# Determine the winner
if user_score > 21:
    print("You went over. You lose 😭")
elif computer_score > 21:
    print("Opponent went over. You win 😁")
elif user_score == computer_score:
    print("It's a draw 🙃")
elif user_score == 0:
    print("You have a Blackjack! You win 🥳")
elif computer_score == 0:
    print("Computer has a Blackjack! You lose 😭")
elif user_score > computer_score:
    print("You win 😁")
else:
    print("You lose 😭")


#Hint 9: Call calculate_score(). If the computer or the user has a blackjack (0) or if the user's score is over 21, then the game ends.

#Hint 10: If the game has not ended, ask the user if they want to draw another card. If yes, then use the deal_card() function to add another card to the user_cards List. If no, then the game has ended.

#Hint 11: The score will need to be rechecked with every new card drawn and the checks in Hint 9 need to be repeated until the game ends.

#Hint 12: Once the user is done, it's time to let the computer play. The computer should keep drawing cards as long as it has a score less than 17.

#Hint 13: Create a function called compare() and pass in the user_score and computer_score. If the computer and user both have the same score, then it's a draw. If the computer has a blackjack (0), then the user loses. If the user has a blackjack (0), then the user wins. If the user_score is over 21, then the user loses. If the computer_score is over 21, then the computer loses. If none of the above, then the player with the highest score wins.

#Hint 14: Ask the user if they want to restart the game. If they answer yes, clear the console and start a new game of blackjack and show the logo from art.py.
