    "#### Introduction to DIJKSTRA ALGORITHM BY PAUL SENTONGO\n",
    "Dijkstra’s algorithm is a popular shortest path algorithm used in graph theory, computer science and transportation planning. It was conceived by Dutch computer scientist Edsger W. Dijkstra in 1956 while he was working on solutions to routing problems at the Mathematical Centre in Amsterdam. Dijkstra’s algorithm has since been adopted across various fields for solving optimization problems that involve finding the shortest path between two points on a graph. The beauty of this dynamic programming approach lies not only in its simplicity but also its efficiency which make it an important tool for many applications such as navigation systems, network routing protocols and even social media algorithms. In this blog post, we will explore Dijkstra’s algorithm from basic principles to implementation details, and understand why it has become one of the most widely-used algorithms in computer science today.\n",

    "Intuition for Dijkstra’s Algorithm\n",
    "Dijkstra’s Algorithm is a popular pathfinding algorithm often used in graph-based problems such as finding the shortest path between two cities on a map, determining the shortest possible route for a delivery truck to take, or even creating game maps.\n",
    "\n",
    "The intuition behind Dijkstra’s Algorithm is based on the principle of visiting all neighboring vertices from a starting vertex while keeping track of the smallest distance from the starting vertex so far. The algorithm operates by following these steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "Create an array that holds the distance of each vertex from the starting vertex. Initially, set this distance to infinity for all vertices except the starting vertex which should be set to 0.\n",
    "Create a priority queue (heap) and insert the starting vertex with its distance of 0.\n",
    "While there are still vertices left in the priority queue, select the vertex with the smallest recorded distance from the starting vertex and visit its neighboring vertices.\n",
    "For each neighboring vertex, check if it is visited already or not. If it isn’t visited yet, calculate its tentative distance by adding its weight to the smallest distance found so far for its parent/previous node (starting vertex in case of first-level vertices).\n",
    "If this tentative distance is smaller than previously recorded value (if any), update it in our ‘distances’ array.\n",
    "Finally, add this visited vertex with its updated distance to our priority queue and repeat step-3 until we have reached our destination or exhausted all nodes.\n",
    "By iterating over all neighboring nodes, we can ensure that we have explored every possible path to determine which has the shortest total cost (distance). We use a priority queue data structure to keep track of which nodes need to be visited next efficiently instead of scanning every node in each iteration.\n",
    "\n",
    "By tracking distances and iterating over neighbors in this fashion we can eventually find our desired minimum path from start node (or rather distances[source]) to other nodes/cities in the graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "That’s the basic intuition behind Dijkstra’s Algorithm! By doing these steps iteratively, we will eventually find out the shortest distance to/from any vertex in a graph starting from our source vertex. Let’s now code this out in Python!\n",
